The preparation for the midterm project has started. I initially planned to build a game where the user has to control the character to dodge the bullets. However, as I was introduced to the sound function of Processing, I decided to try making a rhythm game. Although the concept of the game is vague at this point, I am thinking of building a game where the play has to repeat exactly the randomly generated music pattern of a set of instrument or notes in a correct sequence right after they hear it. 

The pattern would be randomly generated, and each instrument would be assigned to a specific key in the keyboard. The program would check if the player pressed them in the right order at the right time through if statements and arrays.

I have created the basic 4 shapes that would each play different sound. I would have to adjust their positions and sizes later on as I add more features to the game. I added a constant variable of the number of instruments; I also added a void drawDrum() which draws the shapes that represent the instrument buttons.
