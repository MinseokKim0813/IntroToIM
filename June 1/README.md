From the game I developed in last assignment, I applied object oriented programming and changed the number of balls in the game. Functions remained similar but had to be changed for multiple balls instead of the old version with a single ball. In the game, the player is expected to keep bouncing the balls with the bar that is attached to the mouse. There is only one ball in the starting of the game, but each time a ball hits the bar, another additional ball is created in random location in low y-coordinate, and the score increases by 1 as the bar hits a ball. There are maximum 10 balls that can appear, but the game is quite hard to play with 10 balls. Functions that have been used are checking whethere the game is over, bouncing the balls, and updating the speed of the balls. In the beginning, I struggled to make the balls appear one by one as the bar is hit, but I figured out that I can use an array and a new variable bounceCount to make that happen. It was interesting to see how easily I could manage multiple objects in a calss using object oriented programming, instead of manually creating the balls one by one.
