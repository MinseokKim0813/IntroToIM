**Reflection:**

Even though I knew the basic Processing, drawing the self portrait was harder than what I expected - partly because I have forgotten most of the syntax, and largely because I had never drawn such sophisticated artwork on Processing before. Particularly, I had to take a while to figure out how to color the hair in my head without coloring the rest of the face. But I soon realized that I could draw another colored arc to cover the previous arc. It was a fun and interesting activity, and I could certainly get more familiar to Processing.
