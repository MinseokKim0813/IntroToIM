I have created a simple game where the user has to keep the bouncing ball away from the bottom of the screen. The ball bounces back when it touches the wall or the bar that is attached to the cursor, so the user has to move the mouse to control the bar to keep hitting the ball. If the ball touches the bottom and moves out of the screen, text "GAME OVER" appears in the center to indicate that the game is over. It was fun designing the game and using the functions; however, I struggled to create the appropraite conditions to indicate whether the ball has been hit by the bar or not. In the end, however, I figured out how to solve the problem by using the x and y coordinates.
