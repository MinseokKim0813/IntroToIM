For today's assignment, the task was to use at least 1 digital sensor and 1 analogue sensor to make a musical instrument. I have used a switch as a digital sensor and a potentiometer as an analogue sensor. Then, I output the sound using the speaker. It was particularly hard because I had to integrate everything that I have learned so far about the digital sensor, analogue sensor and speaker. However, after a few errors, I understood how to integrate them and was able to successfully build the circuit and program the software. Mapping the input value from the potentiometer into the number of sounds in the array was a little hard, but I managed to successfully program it.
