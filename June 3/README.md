I have created an artwork with randomly created shapes with random x coordinates and rotated them to create the pattern. It was much more challenging that other projects I have worked on so far, mainly becuase of saving each shapes in an array and filling their colors accordingly. Initially, I tried to create a seperate function of filling the color, but after numerous attempts, I figured out that it was much easier to fill the color in the draw() function. It was fun, challengin and interesting project.
