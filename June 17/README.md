For today's assignment, the task was to build a circuit and program that outputs two different patterns with 2 LEDs from 1 analogue sensor and 1 digital sensor. I have used 1 switch for the digital input and 1 light sensor for the analogue input; I used red LED for the digital output and blue LED for analgue output. While the switch is not pressed, the red LED keeps blinking with the delay of 0.1 seconds; when it is pressed, it starts blinking with the delay of 0.5 seconds. And for the blue LED that takes the input from the light sensor, the brightness of it increases when the rooms is darker and gets less bright when the room is bright.

I first built the circuit before programming in Arduino software. Having attended all the classes, it was not so difficult in building the circuit. Programming was not so hard, either.
